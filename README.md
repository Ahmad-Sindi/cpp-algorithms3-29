# Algorithm Challenge #29 – Count Capital and Small Letters (Level 3)

🧠 **Problem Overview**

This challenge analyzes a string by counting uppercase and lowercase letters.
To demonstrate engineering growth, the problem is solved using two different approaches.

---

## 🛠️ Implemented Approaches

### 🔹 Method 1 – Direct Counting
- Uses two dedicated functions
- Simple and beginner-friendly
- Procedural and problem-focused

📄 File: `count_small_capital_letters.cpp`

---

### 🔹 Method 2 – Enum-Based Generalized Design
- Uses an enumeration to control logic
- Single reusable function
- Reduces duplication
- Easier to extend and maintain

📄 File: `CountLettersUsingEnum.cpp`

---

## 🧩 Engineering Insight

Both solutions are correct, but they represent different mindsets:

- **Method 1:** Solve the problem
- **Method 2:** Design for change

This comparison highlights the transition from basic algorithm implementation
to design-aware software engineering.

Example:
-
Input:  
HeLLo World  

Output:  
Capital Letters Count = 3  
Small Letters Count = 7
